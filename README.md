- **Negative functional scenarios** (incorrect or unstable behavior)
- **UI-related behavior** (real-time output updates, input handling)

### Functional coverage includes:
- Sentence structures (simple, compound, complex)
- Interrogative and imperative forms
- Positive and negative sentences
- Tense variations (past, present, future)
- Daily conversational language
- Polite vs informal phrasing
- Slang and colloquial expressions
- Mixed language inputs (Singlish/Thanglish + English)
- English technical terms and abbreviations
- Punctuation, numbers, dates, time, and currency formats
- Input length variations (short, medium, long)
- Formatting issues (spaces, line breaks, paragraphs)

All test cases are automated using **Playwright** and mapped to the Excel test case template provided in the assignment.
